## Overview

**Forza 4 Web Game Two Player VS** is a modern, browser‑based remake of the classic Connect Four game designed exclusively for local two‑player battles. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, it delivers smooth animations, an intuitive turn‑based interface, and competitive multiplayer gameplay directly on your browser — no installation required. Whether you're challenging your friend or just testing strategies, prepare for an arcade‑style showdown!

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Simply host the files on any HTTP/HTTPS server (e.g., Apache, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting service) and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Game Objective:**  
  Be the first to align four of your colored discs in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line on the grid.

- **How to Play:**  
  - **Turn‑Based Multiplayer:** Players take turns selecting a column to drop their disc.  
  - **Interactive Columns:** Click on the desired column to drop your piece into that column.  
  - **Game Rounds:** Continue playing until a player aligns four, or the board fills up for a draw.
  - **Reset Option:** Use the Reset button at any time to start a new game.

- **Controls:**  
  Simply use your mouse (or touch screen) to click on the game grid columns. The simple, intuitive design makes it easy for both players to enjoy the game.
